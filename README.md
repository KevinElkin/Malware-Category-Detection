# Malware-detection

You must first run the docker image present in env.json
This will create a pod.

The code can be run by running the following command - python3 run.py 
By default the data-params.json file is ran. 
If you pass in the command line argument test-project, teset-params.json would be run.
test-params.json is a much smaller subset of the data in comparison to data-params.json.
The parameters that need to be passed into the model are:
    "categories": ["tools"] - categories of benign apps you are interested in
    "scrape_data": 1 - if you want data to be scraped or not from the web
    "number_of_apps_per_cat": 5 - the number of apps in each cateogry of the benign apps
    "outpath": "data" - the path to save all output files
    "malware_categories":["DroidKungFu"] - families of malware you are interested in 
    "malware_path": "/datasets/dsc180a-wi20-public/Malware/amd_data_smali/" - file path of the malware apps on server
    "num_malware_apps":5 - number of malware apps from each family.
    "re_read": 1 - if you want to re-read all the smali files again. 

After running the entire model the classification report from the different kernels will be added as a .txt file in the data directry.
