# Malware-detection

You must first run the docker image present in env.json <br />
This will create a pod.<br />
<br />
The code can be run by running the following command - python3 run.py <br />
By default the data-params.json file is ran. <br />
If you pass in the command line argument test-project, teset-params.json would be run.<br />
test-params.json is a much smaller subset of the data in comparison to data-params.json.<br />
The parameters that need to be passed into the model are:<br />
    "categories": ["tools"] - categories of benign apps you are interested in<br />
    "scrape_data": 1 - if you want data to be scraped or not from the web<br />
    "number_of_apps_per_cat": 5 - the number of apps in each cateogry of the benign apps<br />
    "outpath": "data" - the path to save all output files<br />
    "malware_categories":["DroidKungFu"] - families of malware you are interested in <br />
    "malware_path": "/datasets/dsc180a-wi20-public/Malware/amd_data_smali/" - file path of the malware apps on server<br />
    "num_malware_apps":5 - number of malware apps from each family.<br />
    "re_read": 1 - if you want to re-read all the smali files again. <br />
<br />
After running the entire model the classification report from the different kernels will be added as a .txt file in the data directry.<br />
